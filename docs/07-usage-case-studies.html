<h3>Supporting large enrollment courses at UC Berkeley<a class="headerlink" href="#supporting-large-enrollment-courses-at-uc-berkeley" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University of California at Berkeley started a pilot course titled
“Foundations in Data Science” (also known as Data-8) for about 100
incoming undergraduate students in Fall 2015. Data-8, the fastest
growing course in Berkeley’s history, is entirely Jupyter-based,
allowing the program to scale the course to 1,400 students in 2018.
This scale is made possible by Jupyter’s shared computational
environment. In particular, Jupyter allowed “browser-based
computation, avoiding the need for students to install software,
transfer files, or update libraries” (see The Course of the Future and
the Technology Behind It
[<a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/news/coursefuture">https://data.berkeley.edu/news/coursefuture</a>]). Data-8
is powered by JupyterHub and all the course materials are published
openly (<a class="reference external" href="http://data8.org">http://data8.org</a>).</p>

<h3>Large-scale adoption: Jupyter across Canada<a class="headerlink" href="#large-scale-adoption-jupyter-across-canada" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing the importance of data science, computational research,
and educational resources, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pims.math.ca/">Pacific Institute for the Mathematical
Sciences (PIMS)</a>, in partnership with
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.computecanada.ca/">Compute Canada</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cybera.ca/">Cybera</a>, have launched JupyterHub platforms
(under the project name Syzygy) to support researchers and educators
across Canada. Syzygy (<a class="reference external" href="http://syzygy.ca">http://syzygy.ca</a>) provides
access to cloud-hosted Jupyter resources using existing institutional
credentials and encourages the development of computational and data
science skills. It is currently accessible at 16 institutions across
the country (McMaster, Queen’s, SFU, UAlberta, UBC, UCalgary,
ULethbridge, UNewBrunswick, UOttawa, URegina, USask, UToronto, UVic,
UWashington (US), UWaterloo, Yorku) and has been used by over 11,000
people at those institutions.</p>
<p>Syzygy is extensively used for teaching, but is also being used for
research activities. One notable example is a scientific software
seminar at the University of British Columbia, where graduate students
and post-doctoral researchers meet to share and learn data science
techniques with their peers. Initiatives are also underway, as part of
syzygy, to deepen its relevance into research by providing seamless
access to larger and more varied types of resources (GPUs, parallel
machines, different language kernels etc.).</p>
<p>Callysto (<a class="reference external" href="https://callysto.ca/">https://callysto.ca/</a>) is a related
project, also launched by PIMS and Cybera, to bring Jupyter to
students in Canadian middle and high schools (grades 5-12). Callysto
focuses on creating and curating open content
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/callysto">https://github.com/callysto</a>). This
content forms the basis of project workshops, where teachers can work
through the materials interactively, before taking them back to their
classrooms. The content links to a supporting JupyterHub installation
(integrated with the authentication systems for the networks of school
districts) allowing easy access to the materials and a Jupyter
environment to learn and create in.</p>

<h3>Quick switch: moving an existing course to Python and Jupyter (at the last minute)<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-switch-moving-an-existing-course-to-python-and-jupyter-at-the-last-minute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For many years, our chemical engineering kinetics course had used
software for differential equation and nonlinear simultaneous equation
solving to simulate reactors and solve design problems. The software,
recommended and described by the textbook, was installed in the
college’s computer labs, but licenses for student-owned computers were
expensive and it was only available for Windows.  In Spring 2015, I
was informed my class now had 52 students, but the largest computer
lab had room for only 40. As the semester progressed and we neared the
chapters that required numerical simulation, I rewrote the examples
using Python and SciPy and created Jupyter notebooks, walking students
through the steps involved in setting up and solving the problems. I
found Lorena Barba’s open-source MOOC materials online, and adapted
these for my “getting started” notebooks. I had students install
Anaconda on their own computers, and got everyone up and running
without any central infrastructure or support from the college’s IT
staff. I found the Jupyter Notebook format of including “lecture note”
style commentary along with short, unintimidating, snippets of code,
to be extremely effective. A couple of years later I passed on the
course to a new instructor, who took my course materials, taught
himself some Python, and continued to use Jupyter notebooks for
content delivery and assignments.</p>
<p>The first year was a bit rough around the edges as I introduced it
quite late in the semester. Still, it is clear that the approach
resonated with students. An alumnus from my 2016 course wrote, “I
thought that your course was very successful, especially the use of
Jupyter Notebook as a classroom and assignment tool.  I still remember
specific problems that we went over in class (e.g., the microfluidic
reactor array with heterogeneous catalysis), and I feel that the use
of Python to solve problems throughout the course greatly benefited my
understanding of fundamental concepts.  I went on to use Python [in
the pharmaceutical industry], where I built tools for bioinformatics
data analysis, mutation network profiling for protein engineering
experiments, and RNA structure prediction from experimental data and
molecular thermodynamics.”</p>

module that I began using in class in my Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) course at Boston University in 2009. The 5-week module develops
worked examples that build on each other to incrementally guide the
learner to create a program to solve the Navier-Stokes equations of
fluid mechanics, in 12 steps. In 2013, I was invited to teach a
mini-course in the Latin-American School in High-Performance
Computing, in Argentina. The Jupyter notebooks platform allowed me to
create a guided narrative to support learners with different
background experience and knowledge. For that event, we wrote
notebooks based on the CFD course module, to use as instructional
scaffolding in the 2-full-days of minicourse. Twenty students worked
through the notebooks as self-paced lessons, while I went from desk to
desk asking and answering questions. About four of the students
completed all the lessons in the 2 days, a bulk of them achieved up to
about Step 8, and a few of them lagged behind in Steps 4 or 5 by the
end of the course. For those who completed the full module, they had
achieved in 2 days what my regular students in the classroom normally
took 5 weeks to do. Seeing that was an eye-opening moment: both the
power of worked examples in code, and the ability to allow learners to
follow their own pace made a remarkable difference in these learners.</p>

<p>Based on the experience developing the “CFD Python” learning module,
we adopted this basic design pattern for creating lessons using
computable content:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Break it down into small steps</p></li>
<li><p>Chunk small steps into bigger steps</p></li>
<li><p>Add narrative and connect</p></li>
<li><p>Link out to documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Interleave easy exercises</p></li>
<li><p>Spice with challenge questions/tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Publish openly online</p></li>

<h2>Analyzing music with music21<a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-music-with-music21" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I became interested in learning more about Python in 2013 after
reading a tutorial by Luciano Ramalho as he was writing Fluent
Python. Since I tend to seek out projects that match my outside
interests (music, art, and nature) I was looking for Python projects
with music and came across Myke Cuthbert’s music21 project. Music21,
an open source music theory and analysis library maintained by
Professor Michael Cuthbert at MIT, provides a set of tools to answer
questions about music quickly and simply. Users can create, analyze,
and share music with just a few lines of code. Myke’s use of the
notebook hooked me. Unlike many things that I had worked on before,
the notebooks made it easy to get started and to write small code
snippets that did real work! The more I used the notebooks and showed
them to people that I taught at Fab Lab San Diego, the more that I saw
the power of the notebook to engage a user and empower them to explore
and learn.</p>
<p>Music, a universal language, appeals to learners of all origins, ages,
education levels, and interests. As a subject that casts a wide
appeal, music offers the opportunity to engage and delight
learners. It’s an accessible subject that has a low barrier to entry
for learners from disciplines beyond computer science and engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Misc quotes (perhaps pick a couple?):</strong></p>
<p><em>“I think of music21 as being composed of two parts.  The first is
infrastructure, routines for reading, writing, and manipulating
musical scores, while the second consists of a higher-level analytical
toolkit—generating a Roman numeral from a chord and key, putting
chords into normal form, checking for parallel fifths, identifying
scales containing a given pitch or chord, and so on.”  —Bruce

<h2>Interactive geophysics with Jupyter<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-geophysics-with-jupyter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The GeoSci.xyz project (<a class="reference external" href="https://geosci.xyz">https://geosci.xyz</a>) is
an effort to develop a community of scientists and educators around
learning resources and software for the geosciences. The project
includes multiple open-source textbooks, each which have associated
Jupyter notebook “apps” that serve as interactive simulation engines
for exploring concepts in geophysics. We have used these resources in
an undergraduate course on applied geophysics at the University of
British Columbia; this course is primarily taken by by geologists and
engineers (non-geophysics majors). In 2017, we delivered a 2 day short
course for professionals, graduate students, and researchers in 26
different countries around the world
(<a class="reference external" href="https://disc2017.geosci.xyz">https://disc2017.geosci.xyz</a>). In both
of these courses, the goal is to provide learners with an overview of
the various geophysical methods (e.g. magnetics, gravity, seismic,
electromagnetics) and concepts governing the physics; we do not dive
into details of the math nor do we expect students to program or write
any lines of code. The role of Jupyter notebooks in these courses is
to serve as a tool for visualizing and exploring the physics.</p>
<p>During a lecture, the notebooks as a presentation medium lend to a
dynamic presentation style, where we as instructors can select model
parameters based on student input. Concepts are reinforced as students
then use these same notebooks in labs and assignments. We have found
that the notebook apps are most effective when students are first
asked to critically think about what they expect to see and then
visualize the result. If the resultant image matches their
expectation, then they understand the concept, and if not, it is an
opportunity to learn and further explore.</p>

<h2>Investigating hurricanes<a class="headerlink" href="#investigating-hurricanes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Who</strong></p>
<p>Middle school and high school students visiting Columbia’s School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences on a field trip</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>Students often come through looking to tour labs and experience some
of the research that is being done at the school.  Unfortunately
certain fields, in this case computational mathematics and hurricane
research, do not lend themselves to these types of events.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong></p>
<p>Instead of a lab or lecture a computer lab was reserved for an hour
and a Jupyter notebook used to walk students through some basic
visualizations and data analysis encouraging students to change the
code displayed to answer questions such as “Where did Hurricane Sandy
go?” and “What storms occurred during 1981?”.  This includes a number
of visualizations of hurricane tracks, coloring by strength of storms,
and an analysis of average number of storms per year.  Notebook is
available at https://github.com/applied-math/demos.</p>

<h2>Riemann Problems and Jupyter Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#riemann-problems-and-jupyter-solutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We first envisioned this project as a teaching aid to interactively illustrate difficult concepts for a graduate course in numerical methods for conservation laws. These are physical laws in the form of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations that arise in wave propagation applications such as fluid dynamics, traffic flow, water waves (like tsunamis), and electromagnetic waves among others. The Riemann problem corresponds to a conservation law with a piecewise constant initial condition such that the problem is relatively simple to solve, while still capturing the characteristic dynamics of the conservation law. Due to its discrete nature, its simplicity and its capability to encode the dynamics, the Riemann problem is the key ingredient in modern numerical methods for conservation laws.</p>
<p>The project naturally evolved into Jupyter notebooks with the idea of compiling an interactive book. Each chapter aims to solve the Riemann problem for a specific application such as acoustics, shallow-water equations, and Euler equations. We further wanted to use our book to encourage the reading and publication of interactive notebooks. Therefore, we decided that our book should also have a printed and an HTML version in addition to notebooks available for downloading, to attract more readers and to encourage more authors and publishers to explore this interactive platform.</p>
<p>As one would expect, several new problems arose regarding how to make a book that is somewhat compatible across all the different platforms in which we wanted to present the book, particularly since the notebooks make heavy use of interactive widgets and animations. With the help of our publisher (SIAM) and several developers working on Jupyter-based tools for publishing interactive books, we are close to finalizing the project. We are happy to say that this project promoted the development of some of these tools and that is encouraging our publisher to delve more into interactive book publication.</p>
<p>This book should be completed in the next few months, and the current state can be viewed at http://www.clawpack.org/riemann_book/index.html.</p>
